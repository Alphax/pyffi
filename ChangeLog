Version 0.4.2 (15 Aug 2007)
* kwargs for getRefs
* NIF:
  - fixed bug in skin partition calculation
  - when writing nif files the refs are written in sequence (instead of the links, so missing links will yield an exception, which is a good thing)
  - new functions to get list of extra data blocks and to add effect

Version 0.4.1 (14 Aug 2007)
* NIF:
  - new function to add collision geometries to packed tristripsshape
  - fixed bug in bhkListShape.addShape

Version 0.4 (12 Aug 2007)
* NIF:
  - new function updateBindPosition in NiGeometry to fix a geometry rest position from current bone positions
  - removed deprecated functions
  - (!) changed interface of addBone, no longer takes "transform" argument; use the new function updateBindPosition instead

Version 0.3.4 (11 Aug 2007)
* improved documentation
* fixed the 'in' operator in Bases/Array.py
* NIF:
  - doctest for NiNode
  - flatten skin fix for skins that consist of multiple shapes
  - support for the most common oblivion havok blocks

Version 0.3.3 (8 Aug 2007)
* NIF:
  - fixed a bug in the skin center and radius calculation
  - added copy function to Vector3
  - fixed NiGeometry doctest

Version 0.3.2 (7 Aug 2007)
* simplified interface (still wip) by using keyword arguments for common
functions such as read and write
* NIF:
  - fix for skin partition blocks in older nif versions such as Freedom Force vs. 3rd Reich
  - support for triangle skin partitions
  - added stitchstrips option for skin partitions
  - added a NiGeometry function to send bones to bind pose

Version 0.3.1 (6 Aug 2007):
* NIF:
  - new function for getting geometry skin deformation in rest pose
  - old rest pose functions are deprecated and will be removed from a future release

Version 0.3 (2 Aug 2007):
* NIF:
  - fixed an issue with writing skeleton.nif files
* CGF:
  - reading support for the most common blocks in static cgf files (experimental)

Version 0.2.1 (29 Jul 2007):
* NIF:
  - fixed bug in getTransform
  - new option in findChain to fix block type

Version 0.2 (29 Jul 2007):

* NIF: added getControllers function to NiObjectNET

Version 0.1 (22 Jul 2007):
* bug fixed when writing array of strings
* NIF
