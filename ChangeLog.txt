all functions (i.e. getRefs, getLinks, etc.)
* added more doctests

Version 0.5.2 (25 Oct 2007)
* added hash functions (useful for identifying and comparing objects)

Version 0.4.9 (13 Oct 2007)
* nif: nifoptimize no longer raises an exception on test errors, unless you
pass the -r option
* nif: nifoptimize will try to restore the original file if something goes 
wrong during write, so - in theory - it should no longer leave you with 
corrupt nifs; still it is recommended to keep your backups around just in case
* nif: niftesters recoded to accept arbitrary argument dictionaries; this
could cause incompatibilities for people writing their own scripts, but the
upgrade to the new system is fairly simple: check the niftemplate.py script

normals were not present
