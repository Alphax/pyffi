To run the tools in this directory, you need to install a few other python
libraries. The easiest way to do this, is to run the following scripts:

$ python ez_setup.py

to install setuptools, and then

$ easy_install http://niftools.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/niftools/trunk/pynif

to download and install the packages you need. For NifVis you also need:

$ easy_install PyOpenGL
$ easy_install numpy
$ easy_install pygame
