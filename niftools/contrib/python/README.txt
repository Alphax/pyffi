The python files are organized as follows.

* examples

  - examples/metaclass_simple.py (DONE)

    Proof of concept of how classes could be generated from an xml
    description. This is the only thing really working at the moment.

* File Format Library - representing a file format specified by an XML
  file in Python

  - FileFormat/XmlFileFormat.py (DONE)

    Contains the main metaclass which generates classes for each block
    and compound type.

  - FileFormat/XmlHandler.py (WIP)

    The XML handler, contains the core code that transforms the XML
    file into classes. The parser code is based on NifSkope's XML
    parser.

  - FileFormat/Bases/* (TODO)

    All base classes for various classes generated by the
    XmlFileFormat metaclass.

* Nif Library - instanciate classes, and customize them

  - Nif/Nif.py: instanciates classes for the NIF format

  - Nif/Kfm.py: instanciates classes for the KFM format (TODO, easy)
