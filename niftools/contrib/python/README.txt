The python files are organized as follows.

* examples

  - examples/metaclass_simple.py

    Proof of concept of how classes could be generated from an xml
    description. This is the only thing really working at the moment.

* File Format Library - representing a file format specified by an XML
  file in Python

  - FileFormat/XmlFileFormat.py

    Contains the main metaclass which generates classes for each block
    and compound type.

  - FileFormat/XmlHandler.py

    The XML handler, contains the core code that transforms the XML
    file into classes. The parser code is based on NifSkope's XML
    parser.

  - FileFormat/Bases/*

    All base classes for various classes generated by the
    XmlFileFormat metaclass, i.e. basic, compound, and block.

* NIF Format Library - instanciate classes, and customize them

  - NifFormat/NifFormat.py: instanciates classes for the NIF format

  - NifFormat/KfmFormat.py: instanciates classes for the KFM format (TODO, easy)
