Special thanks to
-----------------

  - Guido van Rossum, and with him many others, for Python, and in particular
    for having metaclasses in Python: metaclasses make PyFFI's implementation
    very easy.
  - m4444x for nifskope, which has been an inspiration for PyFFI's xml based
    design.
  - wz for his support, and for testing of the library, when the first
    version was being written.
  - CryTek for releasing the Far Cry SDK and Crysis SDK, which contains much
    information about the cgf file format. This has saved many months of hard
    work.
  - CryTek and Bethesda for the great games they make.
  - Havok, for releasing their SDK without which PyFFI's mopp generator would
    not have been possible.
